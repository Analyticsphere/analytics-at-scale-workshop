The Quarto Website is live at <https://analyticsphere.github.io/analytics-at-scale-workshop/>

## How to contribute a tutorial

Simply add a *.qmd*, *.rmd*, or *.md* file to the *tutorials/* directory. 

Once it is commited/pushed to main the website will rebuild/deploy to gh-pages. 

If a tutorial lives outside of this tutorial we can add it as a link in the `External Tutorials` tab.
